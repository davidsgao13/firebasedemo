/**
 * The AuthRepository interface abstracts authentication actions, such as signing in with Google.
 * It defines what authentication capabilities are available, but not how they are implemented.
 * Since the domain layer (which contains business logic and use cases) should not depend directly
 * on the data layer (which contains the implementation details of data sources like Firebase), we
 * define an AuthRepository interface in the domain layer to create a boundary between the domain
 * and data layers. This boundary lets us change the implementation in the future
 * (e.g., switch from Firebase to another auth provider) without impacting the domain layer.
